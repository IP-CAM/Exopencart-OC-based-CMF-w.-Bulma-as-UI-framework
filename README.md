# Extended OpenCart
The platform is based on the ocStore open-source e-commerce solution, which in turn is based on the original OpenCart 3 project. Despite the initial focus on the development of online stores, the platform is suitable for solving any tasks in developing websites for business, providing a set of ready-made functional blocks with a clear and logical implementation, which is the same for any site, regardless of the purpose of its creation and the tasks that it must solve.

## Main differences from the standard ocStore
- The default template has been completely rewritten. Bulma is used as a UI framework in the catalog instead of bootstrap.

- Blog functionality has been cleaned of dirt and now works fine.

- Modules that have headers (featured, latest, special, etc) allow you to specify them in several languages and display the specified value on the catalog side (instead of the value taken from the localization file in the base ocStore/OpenCart 3);

- In the system settings, it is possible to add arbitrary contacts, as well as links to instant messengers and social networks;

- The standard ordering mechanism has been completely redesigned (very cumbersome and inconvenient in ocStore/OpenCart 3);

- Updated control panel style;

- Changed the composition and order of items in the main navigation menu of the control panel;

## Why bulma?
I just love it! In my opinion it offers the best balance between pre-made styles (like in bootstrap) and modifiers (like in tailwind), and I also like class naming, it feels more clear and convenient. In addition, Bulma is a CSS framework, without any JS, which allows you to very flexibly control the behavior of the UI components on the site pages.
